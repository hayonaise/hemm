## 📦 What's Inside?

  Pull user info, check group memberships, hunt down stale accounts, and crack on with basic hygiene checks.

- 📁 **File Shares**  
  List shares, audit permissions, clean up stale data — the usual mess that nobody wants to do manually.

- ⚙️ **Network**  
  Various tools and scripts used for accessing and updating network tasks.
